        <p>Terry Gene Bollea (August 11, 1953), known by his ring name Hulk Hogan, 
            is an American professional wrestler, actor, television personality, and musician 
            best known for his time working for WWE.
            Hogan created and financed a restaurant called Pastamania located in the 
            Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. It opened on the Labor Day 
            weekend of 1995 and was heavily promoted on World Championship Wrestling's 
            live show Monday Nitro. The restaurant, which remained in operation for less 
            than a year, featured such dishes as "Hulk-U's" and "Hulk-A-Roos".</p>
